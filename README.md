# kubeflow-istio-ambient-demo
This is a Proof Of Concept for integrating Istio ambient in Kubeflow.

## Instructions
A PoC can be deployed using instructions in the repo. Due to the missing changes in code, manifests need to be applied step by step following the instructions in each directory. Instructions should be followed from the directories in alphabetical order. 

1. clean-setup
2. use-case-a
3. use-case-b
4. use-case-c

## Use cases
The following use cases are covered from the migration:
1. User login flow (use-case-a directory)
2. Web application access through the UI (use-case-a directory)
2. KFP components access from a userâ€™s pods (use-case-b directory)
